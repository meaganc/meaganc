Hi! I'm Meagan and I enjoy reading, writing and traveling. I am a proud devotee to Cheese Board Pizza, and schedule Bay Area visits around their menu. After four years in Los Angeles working in digital Hollywood, I spent the last couple months backpacking around New Zealand and Australia. Check out my <a href='/travels'>map</a>. I studied history at UC Berkeley, and my PhD-substitute research interests are Internet-mediated communities and protest movements and the early American space program. I mostly code in Ruby and Javascript, and this year have focused on upping my Python game because of my interest in GIS. My favorite books of the last year include <a href='https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/26114291-ghost-talkers'>Ghost Talkers</a>, <a href='https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/26042254-the-last-days-of-new-paris'>Last Days of New Paris</a>, <a href='https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/26114545-too-like-the-lightning'>Too Like the Lightning</a>, and <a href='https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/25982541-join'>Join</a>. My reading goal for the year was to read more nonfiction, but alas, none of those selections earned a place in my favorite books.


Here are some of my recent photos:
